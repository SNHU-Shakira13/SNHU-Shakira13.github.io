    <h1>CS 499 - Computer Science Capstone</h1>

    <p>Hi! My name is Shakira Baker and I've attended Southern New Hampshire University for about 2 years. Before attending SNHU I had already successfully completed some courses at previous colleges and through my career in the Army National Guard. This eportfolio will highlight the skills I've gained over the years throughout my computer science journey with SNHU. Below you will find a link to a code review where I thoroughly explained the starting code and the enhancements I planned to make. You will also find a description of the capstone project I completed with an explanation of how I satisfied the 3 required categories for this project which were Software Design/Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases. Lastly, I have added a Professional Self Assessment to further explain valuable tools that I've added to my toolkit over the years while learning at SNHU that have better prepared me to pursue various careers in the computer science field.</p>

        <summary>Project Details</summary>
        <p>The artifact I chose to enhance is one of the first projects I completed when I started my journey at SNHU back in January or February of 2023. It is a text-based video game that I developed using Python in IT 140: Introduction to Scripting. The goal of the project was to develop a text-based video game that allowed a user to enter the text “Go North, Go South, Go East, or Go West” to navigate through a maze of rooms that was provided to us. We were able to decide the theme of the game, what each room would be, and what items would be available to collect in each room. Each room only had certain directions available depending on the direction of the openings displayed in the provided map. The player had to visit each room and collect an item to have everything necessary to kill the boss in the final room. If the player failed to collect all the items they would lose the boss fight, otherwise they would succeed. I chose this artifact because it was a simple project with a lot of potential, and I knew that with more development knowledge and skills, I could take it much further. Even in its original form, the project demonstrated my ability to code in Python, write modular functions for specific tasks, and create well-organized, well-commented code that was easy to follow. I enjoyed building it and wanted to improve the user experience by making it more engaging.</p>

        <p><b>Software Design/Engineering: </b></p>
<p> To satisfy this category I enhanced the project significantly by converting it from Python to C#, restructuring it into multiple classes and methods. I added a database to support user login, saving, and loading game states, which didn't exist before. I’ve also started building the interface using WinForms, separating the login and game screens into two forms for better organization. Security features like input validation, password masking, and character limits were added to the login screen, along with password hashing for secure storage and verification. I implemented error handling to avoid null values and improve performance, and used internal classes with private variables accessed through getters and setters to strengthen encapsulation. These improvements highlight my growth in software development, from basic scripting to building more complex, secure, and user-friendly applications.</p>
